                    film producer, and two Filmfare Awards as an actor.[4] He is cited in the media as one of the most
                    commercially successful actors of Indian cinema.[5][6] Forbes has included Khan in listings of the
                    highest-paid celebrities in the world, in 2015 and 2018, with him being the highest-ranked Indian in the
                    latter year.[7][8][9][10]
